This letter is confirming my interest in the Summer 2014 Internship position at SpaceX. I am very interested in SpaceX as a company. I've been melancholy about NASA's lack of funding compared to the overall US governmental budget, and even then somewhat uneasy about a state-sponsored space exploration program. I believe that space exploration is the most important effort humans can make over the next 50 to 100 years, and I'm incredibly excited that an innovative privately-owned company like SpaceX exists to push that frontier.


My skills lie in the realm of Computer Science and I am confident that I am capable of helping SpaceX achieve its goals. I have a lot left to learn, though, which is why I am applying for an Internship at this cutting-edge company. In addition to my strengths in Computer Science, I have a great aptitude for learning quickly, which I believe will help me fit in at SpaceX where my skills will be applied in conjunction with Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering disciplines. 


I chose SpaceX because I believe in your mission and I believe that I am capable of helping you reach your mission goals. While there are a lot of great opportunities in innovative Bay Area tech companies for people with my skillset, I firmly believe that developing the tech and amassing the resources necessary to propel humans outside of Earth will do more good for the planet than any API or SaaS platform ever could.


I hope that you will seriously consider me for a position in your company this coming Summer. I am also available for Fall 2014 and Winter/Spring 2015 if that works better. I am incredibly excited to apply for this position, and I sincerely look forward to your response.
